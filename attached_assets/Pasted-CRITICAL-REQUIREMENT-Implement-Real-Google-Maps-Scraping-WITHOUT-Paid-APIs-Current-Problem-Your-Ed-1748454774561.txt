CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Implement Real Google Maps Scraping WITHOUT Paid APIs
Current Problem:
Your Edge Function is only returning mock data and the suggested solution uses Google Places API which costs money. You specifically need FREE scraping without any paid APIs.
SOLUTION: Implement Web Scraping in Supabase Edge Function
Step 1: Understanding the Challenge
Supabase Edge Functions run on Deno runtime, not Node.js. This means you cannot use Playwright directly. However, you CAN use web scraping techniques that work in Deno environment.
Step 2: Use Deno-Compatible Web Scraping
Replace the mock data generation with actual web scraping using Deno's built-in fetch and DOM parsing capabilities. You need to:

Fetch Google Maps search results directly via HTTP requests
Parse the HTML response to extract business data
Handle Google's anti-bot measures with proper headers and delays

Step 3: Implement HTML Parsing
Use Deno's HTML parsing libraries like "deno-dom" or "cheerio" equivalent for Deno to parse the Google Maps HTML and extract business information like names, addresses, phone numbers, ratings, and websites.
Step 4: Add Stealth Techniques
Implement anti-detection measures in your Edge Function:

Rotate user agents for each request
Add random delays between requests
Use proper HTTP headers to mimic real browser requests
Handle rate limiting by spacing out requests

Step 5: Handle Google Maps URLs
Instead of using the Places API, construct direct Google Maps search URLs and scrape the results pages. Google Maps has predictable URL patterns for searches that you can exploit.
Step 6: Data Extraction Strategy
Focus on scraping the publicly visible Google Maps search results page, not individual business pages. Extract the business cards that appear in search results which contain most of the essential information.
Alternative Approach: Hybrid Solution
If direct HTML scraping proves too complex due to Google's JavaScript-heavy interface, consider implementing a headless browser solution using Puppeteer for Deno or similar Deno-compatible browser automation tools.
Implementation Priority:
Start with simple HTTP requests and HTML parsing. If that doesn't work due to JavaScript requirements, then move to browser automation solutions that work in Deno environment.
Expected Outcome:
Your Edge Function should be able to take a search query like "restaurants in Munich" and return real business data scraped directly from Google Maps without using any paid APIs or services.
Testing Strategy:
Test with simple searches first, then gradually increase complexity. Make sure to handle errors gracefully and implement proper retry logic for failed requests.
